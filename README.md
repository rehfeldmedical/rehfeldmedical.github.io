# Vital Beats Engineering blog

This is our Engineering blog, built using Jekyll + GitHub pages, currently using the 'Minima' theme as a gem-based theme.

# Setup

1. Follow [jekyll-installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to ensure you have Ruby, Jekyll and Bundler.
1. Run `bundle install`

The repository contains a `.tool-versions` file, so you can also manage your Ruby version via e.g., [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) or similar.

# Run the site locally

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the site locally. It will run in watch mode and pick up _most_ changes you
make.
